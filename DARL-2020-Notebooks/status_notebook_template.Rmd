## Instructions: Submitting Notebook via github (DELETE BEFORE SUBMISSION)

* Use this notebook is a template for your weekly project status assignment. 
* Use the sections starting with **Weekly Work Summary** as your outline for your submitted notebook.
* Summarize ALL of your work in this notebook; **if you don't show and/or link to your work here, it doesn't exist for us!**

1. Create a fresh github branch of your team's project repository in which to do your work. Use a branch name line `darl-yourname-date`

1. Create a **copy** of this notebook file in the `DARL-2020-Notebooks` sub-directory of your team's github repository using the following naming convention

   * `darl_rcsid_ddmmmyyyy.Rmd` (your notebook source file) 
   * `darl_rcsid_ddmmmyyyy.html` (your knitted notebook)
   * For example, `darl_erickj4_16Sep2020.Rmd` and `darl_erickj4_16Sep2020.html`
   * **Please** don't make up your own naming syntax!

2. Document **all** the work you did on your assigned project this week **using the outline below.** 

3. You MUST include figures and/or tables to illustrate your work. *Screen shots are okay*, but include something!

4. You MUST include links to other important resources (knitted HTMl files, Shiny apps). See the guide below for help.

5. You MUST commit the source (`.Rmd`) and knitted (`.html`) versions of your notebook and push to github

6. **Submit a pull request** on github.rpi.edu. Please notify Dr. Erickson if you don't see your notebook merged within one day. 

7. **DO NOT MERGE YOUR PULL REQUESTS YOURSELF!!**

## Guide to linking to your knitted notebook on github (DELETE BEFORE SUBMISSION)

Part of the assignment is to provide a link to your knitted notebook on github. This section explains how to link to knitted notebooks (ie HTML) files.

1. For files merged with the master on the public github, provide a direct link in your notebook using the following example pattern:

    * Preface: `https://htmlpreview.github.io/? `
    * Repo and branch: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Twitter/master/ `
    * Directory and file: `DARL-2020-Notebooks/status_notebook_template.html'

* Example for projects on the public github (COVIDMINDER, COVID Twitter):

https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Twitter/master/HACL-2020-Notebooks/status_notebook_template.html 

2. For files merged with the master on the RPI github (e.g. Back-to-School, StudySafe, SafeCampus) you need a different syntax; here's a few examples:

    * https://pages.github.rpi.edu/DataINCITE/DARL-2020/Notebooks/status-notebook-template.html
    * https://pages.github.rpi.edu/DataINCITE/DARL-2020/Circadian/status-notebook-template.html
    
To obtain this link, browse to your merged html on http://github.rpi.edu , grab the link from the address bar of your browser, and insert `pages` into the subdomain of the address as shown above. 

3. Test your link by pasting in a browser and verifying that you see your notebook
4. Paste your working link into the assignment form on LMS. 

You may also want to use this technique to reference other notebooks on github. 

## Guide to linking to Shiny Apps (DELETE BEFORE SUBMISSION)

In your notebook you can also link to Shiny apps you and others have created

* On the cluster, create a sub-directory called `ShinyApps` in your home directory

    * In RStudio in the **Terminal** tab, `cd ~`
    * Then `mkdir ShinyApps`
    * You only need to do this once
    
* In your new `ShinyApps` sub-directory, create a sub-directory to contain your app

    * In the **Terminal** tab, `cd ~/ShinyApps` 
    * Then `mkdir yourcoolapp` (if `yourcoolapp` is the name of your app)
    * Then copy all of the files associated with your app (esp. the `app.R`) in that directory
    
* Alternatively, you can create a symbolic link in that directory, "pointing" to your working directory. In this way your shared app will always be up-to-date.

    * In the **Terminal** tab, `cd ~/ShinyApps` 
    * Then (for example) `ln -s /home/yourrcs/yourappdirectory yourcoolapp` 

* You can now share your app on the RPI network using this syntax:

    * `http://lp01.idea.rpi.edu/shiny/yourrcs/yourcoolapp/` 

## REQUIRED: Weekly Work Summary
