## Weekly Work Summary	

* RCS ID: zhangh20
* Project Name: idea-covid-twitter
* Summary of work since last week 

    * These week, I have continued to set up the GUI (Shiny App) for our project (covid-twitter) using the elasticsearch. Since we have already have the codes. However, it still have little problem (small bugs) I am continuing debuging and settign the UI and the server codes. 
    
* Summary of github commits 

    * branch name: https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Twitter/tree/darl-zhangh20
    * Shiny app: https://lp01.idea.rpi.edu/shiny/zhangh20/TweetShiny/

* List of references (if necessary)
    * https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Twitter/blob/master/analysis/paper_app.R

    * https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Twitter/blob/master/analysis/twitter_quotes.Rmd
    
* Indicate any use of group shared code base
  * https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Twitter/blob/master/analysis/text_helpers.R
  * https://github.com/TheRensselaerIDEA/COVID-Twitter/blob/master/analysis/plot_helpers.R
  i use codes from Abraham about the helpers function and the structure to deal with the dataframe 
  
* Indicate which parts of your described work were done by you or as part of joint efforts
  * The UI implementation and the server function is worked by me. 
## Personal Contribution	

* In this week, I have learned codes from Abraham and Lauren's codes to set up the active Shiny app for our project. I am setting up a shiny app which can show the graph and have an ability to set up different variable. From different variables, it can be done and show the different outputs. I am searching / designing the logic of the shiny app and also set up and implement the UI and also organize the coeds for the backend. 

## Discussion of Primary Findings 	

* Discuss primary findings: 
  * As we can see, from the tweet counts by sentiment. There are strong difference between Negative, neutral, and positive counts. Which may influence the general sentiment change over over time. Hence, once we are talking about the general sentiment of tweets. We may focus more on the divisiveness (which is included in the notebook, but not included in the Shiny App) Meanwhile, when we talk about the divisiveness, it is also interesting to see how variance between the positive or negative tweets. It is has a strong similarity? or in a small range? Since we can see the there are a lot of large positive and negative counts of tweets compare to the counts of neutral.
