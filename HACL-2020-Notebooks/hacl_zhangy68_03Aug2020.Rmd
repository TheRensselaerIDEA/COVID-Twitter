## Discussion of Primary Findings 	

* Discuss primary findings: 

    * What did you want to know? 
      * I wanted to know more about other ways that covid mask data can be analyzed. I also wanted to find more semantic words for mask.
    * How did you go about finding it? 
      * Researched mask articles on the internet, used the semantic search notebook to conduct a search on masks.
    * What did you find? 
      * I found an article that used google trends data to find the relationship between public interest in masks and number of daily infections. I found multiple tweets with mentions of mask, but not other related terms
