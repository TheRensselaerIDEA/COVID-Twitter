## Weekly Work Summary	

* Summary of work since last week 
<br>**Team scope:**<br>
We clarified the purpose of the whole project during the meeting last week. For COVID-Twitter project, we could have multiple aims but this project should be a team project. As a team each person will contribute to different parts. We initially defined short term and long term aims.
<U> Short term aim: </U>to get the sentiment analysis about masks first. 
<U>Long term aim:</U> do some time series analysis. We would like to find the correlation between some policy announcements and the twitter users’ attitude.
<br>**Personal scope:**<br>
I had the brainstorm to determine my project “A time series analysis about twitter users’ mental health during COVID-19”. However, as a new NLP learner this time series analysis is not the one we could immediately get done in 6 weeks. I decided to help Albraham to solve the open issues on Github. In this way, I think I can have a deep understanding of his code. The backend engineering is the part I need to catch up. I think my advantage is that I have creative ideas. I know the process to get things done. However, the knowledge of R coding, NLP and data analysis is the obstacle I have. So I did things in the following ‘Personal contribution’ part.

## Personal Contribution	

* Clearly defined, unique contribution done by you (code, ideas, writing)
<br>**-Reading:**<br>
Blog about NLP and examples (link in references)

<br>**-Coding:**<br>
Text clustering using Python and the bbc dataset. For choosing the optimal k value, I tried both the elbow method and the silhouette score method. 
Text clustering using R and covid-twitter dataset. Implementing the **silhouette score** method to replace the **elbow method**.

## Discussion of Primary Findings 	

* Discuss primary findings: 

    * What did you want to know? 
    <br>
    I am wondering if the silhouette score is a good way to replace the elbow method.<br>
    * How did you go about finding it? 
    <br>
    I implemented the silhouette score method. I chose k from 2 to 10 based on my experience when I changed the k. Then I     give a list of the silhouette score. Just choose the highest score to redo the clustering. Then I compared it with       the original cluster result. It looks much better. <br>

    * What did you find?
    <br>
    I found this method works well in Python. I decided to add it to Abraham’s code with R in his Rmarkdown file. <br>
	
* Provide illustrating figures and or tables
